# Elegant-Mind-Collaboration
MATLAB/Python scripts written for the Elegant Mind Collaboration under Professor Katsushi Arisaka, at UCLA

These are experiments I designed and coded to test visual acuity in human subjects under various conditions, to provide evidence for Professor Arisaka's theory about human processing of semantic visual information.

As of December 2019, we are still working on finalizing the experiment protocols and taking internal data. In January we will recruit physics students from Professor Arisaka's classes at UCLA and begin actual data collection. We hope to publish a paper based on these experiments by June 2020. 

If you'd like to learn more about the research that we are doing, or inquire about joining the Elegant Mind Collaboration, feel free to email me at patrickmwilson@ucla.edu, or Professor Arisaka at arisaka@physics.ucla.edu.
