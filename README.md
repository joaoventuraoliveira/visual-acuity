# Visual-Acuity
Python, MATLAB, Arduino, and LabVIEW scripts written for the Elegant Mind Collaboration under Professor Katsushi Arisaka, at UCLA

All Python, MATLAB, and Arduino scripts written by Patrick Wilson
LabVIEW scripts written by River Govin and Javier Carmona

These are experiments coded to test visual acuity in human subjects under various conditions, to provide evidence for Professor Arisaka's theory about human processing of semantic visual information.

As of February 2019, we are collecting data subjects recruited from the undergraduate student body at UCLA. We hope to publish a paper by June 2020.

If you'd like to learn more about the research that we are doing, or inquire about joining the Elegant Mind Collaboration, feel free to email me at patrickmwilson@ucla.edu, or Professor Arisaka at arisaka@physics.ucla.edu.
