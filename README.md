# Visual-Acuity
Python, MATLAB, Arduino, and LabVIEW scripts written for the Elegant Mind Collaboration under Professor Katsushi Arisaka at UCLA

All Python, MATLAB, and Arduino scripts written by Patrick Wilson.

LabVIEW scripts written by River Govin and Javier Carmona.

These are experiments coded to test visual acuity in human subjects under various conditions, to provide evidence for Professor Arisaka's theory about human processing of semantic visual information.

As of May 2020, we are preparing a publication for peer review based upon our results.

If you'd like to learn more about the research that we are doing, or inquire about joining the Elegant Mind Collaboration, feel free to email me at patrickmwilson@ucla.edu, or Professor Arisaka at arisaka@physics.ucla.edu.
