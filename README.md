# Visual-Acuity
Python, MATLAB, Arduino, and LabVIEW scripts written for the Elegant Mind Collaboration under Professor Katsushi Arisaka at UCLA. These experiments are designed to test human visual acuity under various crowding conditions.

All Python, MATLAB, and Arduino scripts written by Patrick Wilson. LabVIEW scripts written by River Govin and Javier Carmona.

The PsychoPy and Psychtoolbox scripts can be found within this folder: Isolated Character, Crowded Center 3x3, Crowded Center 9x9, Crowded Periphery, Crowded Periphery Outer, Crowded Periphery 5x5, Crowded Periphery 7x7, Crowded Periphery 9x9, Three Lines, and Fully Crowded. Photos of each protocol can be found within the Protocol Pictures subfolder.

All of the raw data that was collected can be found within the Analysis/Data subfolder, and he MATLAB scripts written to analyze it and produce plots can be found within the Analysis subfolder.

As of May 30, 2020, we are preparing a publication for peer review and publication in the Journal of Vision based upon these experiments. If you'd like to learn more about the research that we are doing, or inquire about joining the Elegant Mind Collaboration, feel free to email me at patrickmwilson@ucla.edu, or Professor Arisaka at arisaka@physics.ucla.edu.
