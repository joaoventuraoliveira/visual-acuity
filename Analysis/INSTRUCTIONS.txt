	ANALYSIS NOTES 
-------------------------------------------

1.To run the script you need several Matlab add-ons, including Globalsearch, the optimization toolbox, and the curve fitting toolbox. 
2. The 'Data' subfolder contains all recorded data. To run a specific subject's data all you need to know is their subject code/name and the session type (Study/Pilot).
3. If you saved the plots, they can be found within the 'Plots' subfolder, into another subfolder depending upon the data type (Study/Pilot).
4. Parameters relating to the fit will be output to the 'one_parameter_statistics' and the 'two_parameter_statistics' spreadsheets within this folder.
5. Results from the significance tests for left vs. right can be found in the left_vs_right.csv file within the 'Parameters' subfolder.
6. Results from the significance tests for protocol vs. protocol can be found in the protocol_comparisons.csv file within the 'Parameters' subfolder.
7. Plots resulting from the correlation analysis can be found within the Plots/Correlation subfolder.
